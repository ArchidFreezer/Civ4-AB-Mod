# Civ4-AB-Mod
Civ 4 mod that has as its core K-Mod with the Platy UI and selected Bug/BULL features

The main branch of this code is not intended to have significant gameplay changes, but rather be a restructuring and simplification of the OOB XML and also have additional dll functionality. In order to create a working mod with gameplay changes a branch should be created that can be rebased when updatres to the main branch are created.
