    <tr><td><span class="tagoptional">iNumBuildingsGlobal</span><td>0<td>Specifies the minimum amount of buildings listed in <BuildingsRequired> that the player must have in total for the trigger to activate
    <tr><td><span class="tagoptional">iNumCorporations</span><td>0<td>Specifies how many of the corporations listed in <CorporationsRequired> must be present for the trigger to activate. If <CorporationsRequired> has been left empty, then any corporations will do. For example, for a trigger that affects a city, if <CorporationsRequired> is empty and <iNumCorporations> is 2, then cities with at least different 2 corporations in them will be eligible for the trigger. 
    <tr><td><span class="tagoptional">iNumPlotsRequired</span><td>0<td>Should be set to 1 for triggers that require a plot that meets specific conditions.
    <tr><td><span class="tagoptional">iNumReligions</span><td>0<td>Specifies how many of the religions listed in <ReligionsRequired> must be present for the trigger to activate. If <ReligionsRequired> has been left empty, then any religions will do.

    <tr><td><span class="tagoptional">iPlotType</span><td>-1<td>Specifies the plot type that the plot must have to meet the condition. Set to -1 to ignore plot type. 0 stands for peaks (PLOT_PEAK), 1 for hills (PLOT_HILLS), 2 for land plots (PLOT_LAND) and 3 for ocean plots (PLOT_OCEAN)
    <tr><td><span class="tagoptional">iUnhealthy</span><td>0<td>Minimum unhealthiness level of a city for the trigger to fire. Only applicable when the target is a city
    <tr><td><span class="tagoptional">iUnitDamagedWeight</span><td>0<td>Affects the probability of the trigger activating for wounded units. The value is multiplied by the units damage to determine the final trigger weight so higher values make the trigger more likely to fire for wounded units
    <tr><td><span class="tagoptional">iUnitDistanceWeight</span><td>0<td>For events that affect a plot, affects the probability of the trigger activating for wounded units. The value is multiplied by the units distance to the plot to determine the final trigger weight so higher values make the trigger more likely to fire for far away units
    <tr><td><span class="tagoptional">iUnitExperienceWeight</span><td>0<td>Affects the probability of the trigger activating for experienced units. The value is multiplied by the units experience to determine the final trigger weight so higher values make the trigger more likely to fire for experienced unitsWhen set to 1, increases the probability of triggering for a highly-experienced unit
    <tr><td><span class="tagoptional">iWeight</span><td>0<td>Relative probability that this event will be triggered if all its prereqs are met. If this is set to -1 it will always trigger when it can. If it is higher than 0 then the valid trigger with the highest value will be fired.

  <h3 id="boolean">Boolean</h3>
  <table>
    <tr><th>Tag<th>Default<th>Purpose
    <tr><td><span class="tagoptional">bGlobal</span><td>0<td>If true, applies to all players. That means that, when triggered for one player, it's considered to have triggered for all players. Combined with <bRecurring> set to 0, it will result in triggers that can only happen once per game.
    <tr><td><span class="tagoptional">bHeadquarters</span><td>0<td>If true, and <bPickCorporation> is 1 then the player must own the corporation's headquarters in order for it to be picked. If the trigger also picks a city, then the picked city must be the corporation headquarters. Works like <bHolyCity> does for religions
    <tr><td><span class="tagoptional">bHolyCity</span><td>0<td>If true, and <bPickReligion> is 1, then the player must own the religion's holy city in order for it to be picked. If the trigger also picks a city, then the picked city must be the religion's holy city. For example, if <bPickReligion>, <bStateReligion>, <bHolyCity> are all 1 and the trigger picks a city (<bPickCity> is also 1), then the city picked will be the holy city of the player's state religion, provided he owns that city.
    <tr><td><span class="tagoptional">bOtherPlayerAI</span><td>0<td>If true, then the other player must be an AI player.
    <tr><td><span class="tagoptional">bOtherPlayerHasOtherReligion</span><td>0<td>If true, the other player must have a different religion than the picked one. If <bStateReligion> is 1, then the other player's state religion must be different.
    <tr><td><span class="tagoptional">bOtherPlayerHasReligion</span><td>0<td>If true, then the other player must have the religion picked by the trigger (see <bPickReligion>). If <bStateReligion> is 0, then the other player must have the religion somewhere in his empire. If <bStateReligion> is 1, then the other player must have the same state religion. 
    <tr><td><span class="tagoptional">bOtherPlayerWar</span><td>0<td>If true, then the trigger can activate when the affected player and the other player are at war. When set to 1, the trigger activates for player pairs at peace
    <tr><td><span class="tagoptional">bOwnPlot</span><td>0<td>If true, the plot must be owned by the player for the trigger to fire
    <tr><td><span class="tagoptional">bPickCity</span><td>0<td>If true, then the trigger will pick a city. 
    <tr><td><span class="tagoptional">bPickCorporation</span><td>0<td>If true, then a corporation will be picked by the trigger. The corporation must be present in the player's civilization to be picked
    <tr><td><span class="tagoptional">bPickOtherPlayerCity</span><td>0<td>If true, then the trigger will pick one of the other player's cities. 
    <tr><td><span class="tagoptional">bPickPlayer</span><td>0<td>If true, then the trigger will pick another player to affect by the event. This is how events that give stuff to other players or affect relations with them are created. The specific player who gets selected can be further narrowed down by the six tags starting with [bi]OtherPlayer.
    <tr><td><span class="tagoptional">bPickReligion</span><td>0<td>If true, the trigger will pick a religion for the events that it activates. Which religion is picked can be further specified by the other variables
    <tr><td><span class="tagoptional">bPrereqEventPlot</span><td>0<td>For triggers that have PrereqEvents specified, if set to 1, means that the trigger will fire on the same plot where the prerequisite events fired. This is used with triggers such as continuing slave revolts or dustbowls - if the prerequisite event has fired, dustbowl or revolts will, if triggered, happen again in the same place where they did before. 
    <tr><td><span class="tagoptional">bProbabilityBuildingMultiply</span><td>0<td>If true, the probability of the trigger firing increases with each additional building. Only used in conjunction with iNumBuildings.
    <tr><td><span class="tagoptional">bProbabilityUnitMultiply</span><td>0<td>If true, the probability of the trigger firing increases with each additional unit. Only used in conjunction with &lt;iNumUnits&gt;
    <tr><td><span class="tagoptional">bRecurring</span><td>0<td>If true,  the trigger can activate multiple times throughout the game for the same player. If set to 0, it can only activate once per player. Note that the <ClearEvents> field in event description can reset events, making the game forget they have occurred.
    <tr><td><span class="tagoptional">bShowPlot</span><td>0<td>If true, then the plot in which the event happens will be visually highlighted.
    <tr><td><span class="tagoptional">bSinglePlayer</span><td>0<td>If true, the event can only trigger in single player games
    <tr><td><span class="tagoptional">bStateReligion</span><td>0<td>If true, and <bPickReligion> is 1, then the affected player's state religion will be picked.
    <tr><td><span class="tagoptional">bTeam</span><td>0<td>If true,  the trigger applies to all players on the same team.
    <tr><td><span class="tagoptional">bUnitsOnPlot</span><td>0<td>If true, the trigger will only fire if the player has units on the plot
