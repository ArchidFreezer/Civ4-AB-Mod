	<TEXT> <!-- Camp -->
		<Tag>TXT_KEY_IMPROVEMENT_CAMP_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB]The term camp comes from the Latin word campus, meaning "field". Therefore, a campsite consists typically of open pieces of ground where a camper can pitch a tent or park a camper.

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_IMPROVEMENT_CITY_RUINS_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB]Ruins are the remains of human-made architecture: structures that were once complete, as time went by, have fallen into a state of partial or complete disrepair, due to lack of maintenance or deliberate acts of destruction. Disasters, war and depopulation are the most common root causes, with many structures becoming progressively derelict over time due to long-term weathering and scavenging.</English>

	<TEXT> <!-- Cottage -->
		<Tag>TXT_KEY_IMPROVEMENT_COTTAGE_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB]In modern usage, a cottage is usually a modest, often cozy dwelling, typically in a rural or semi-rural location. However there are cottage-style dwellings in cities, and in places such as Canada the term exists with no connotations of size at all (cf. vicarage or hermitage). In the United Kingdom the term cottage also tends to denote rural dwellings of traditional build, although it can also be applied to dwellings of modern construction which are designed to resemble traditional ones ("mock cottages").</English>

	<TEXT> <!-- Hamlet -->
		<Tag>TXT_KEY_IMPROVEMENT_HAMLET_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB]A hamlet is usually a rural settlement which is too small to be considered a village, though sometimes the word is used for a different sort of community. The name comes from Anglo-Norman hamelet(t)e; Old French hamelet, the diminutive of Old French hamel. Another diminutive of Old French ham is possibly a cognate with similar words of Germanic origin. Compare with Dutch heem, German Heim, Swiss German cham or -kon, Old English ham and Modern English home, all derived from the Proto-Germanic *kham-. Historically, when a hamlet became large enough to justify building a church, it was then classified as a village. One example of a hamlet is a small cluster of houses surrounding a mill.</English>

	<TEXT> <!-- Village -->
		<Tag>TXT_KEY_IMPROVEMENT_VILLAGE_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB]A village is a clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet with the population ranging from a few hundred to a few thousands (sometimes tens of thousands), Though often located in rural areas, the term urban village is also applied to certain urban neighbourhoods, such as the West Village in Manhattan, New York City and the Saifi Village in Beirut, Lebanon, as well as Hampstead Village in the London conurbation. Villages are normally permanent, with fixed dwellings; however, transient villages can occur. Further, the dwellings of a village are fairly close to one another, not scattered broadly over the landscape, as a dispersed settlement.</English>

	<TEXT> <!-- Town -->
		<Tag>TXT_KEY_IMPROVEMENT_TOWN_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB]A town is a human settlement larger than a village but smaller than a city. The size a settlement must be in order to be called a "town" varies considerably in different parts of the world, so that, for example, many American "small towns" seem to British people to be no more than villages, while many British "small towns" would qualify as cities in the United States.</English>

	<TEXT> <!-- Pasture -->
		<Tag>TXT_KEY_IMPROVEMENT_PASTURE_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB]Pasture is land with vegetation cover used for grazing of livestock as part of a farm, or in ranching or other unenclosed pastoral systems or used by wild animals for grazing or browsing. Prior to the advent of factory farming, pasture was the primary source of food for grazing animals such as cattle and horses. It is still used extensively, particularly in arid regions where pasture land is unsuitable for any other agricultural production. In more humid regions, pasture grazing is exploited extensively for free range and organic farming.</English>

		<English>[TAB]A quarry is a type of open-pit mine from which rock or minerals are extracted. Quarries are generally used for extracting building materials, such as dimension stone, construction aggregate, riprap, sand, and gravel. They are often colocated with concrete and asphalt plants due to the requirement for large amounts of aggregate in those materials. The word quarry can include underground quarrying for stone, such as Bath stone.</English>

Various coastal communities have long histories of sustenance whaling and harvesting beached whales. Industrial whaling emerged with organized fleets in the 17th century; competitive national whaling industries in the 18th and 19th centuries; and the introduction of factory ships along with the concept of whale harvesting in the first half of the 20th century.</English>

The main use was originally for a grinding mill powered by the wind, reducing a solid or coarse substance into pulp or minute grains, by crushing, grinding, or pressing. Windmills have also been used to power sawmills and other industrial processes and as windpumps for obtaining fresh water from underground or for drainage of land.</English>
