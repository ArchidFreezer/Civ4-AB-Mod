##-------------------------------------------------------------------
## Modified from Abandon Raze City by unknown, Bhruic, Nemo, OrionVetran
##  by Dancing Hoskuld with a great deal of help from EmperorFool and Zappara
##  to work in, with and under BUG
##  Minor edit by zeroRPGmaker so mods works correctly with BUG 4.2 under BTS 1.19
##-------------------------------------------------------------------
##
## Things that could be done to improve this mod making it interact with the main mod in a more generic fashon.
## 1. replace the English language stuff with the correct language translations in the text file.
##-------------------------------------------------------------------
##
## To get this working in any mod you need to
## 1. put 	<load mod="Abandon City Mod"/>	in the init.xml in the Python/Config directory
##
## Modders:- If you want any special events when a city is abandoned add them to your OnCityRazed event.
##		This mod calls that event.
##  In RoM Holy Shrines are not world wonders a fix to reflect this is in the code it should have no effect
##    on other mods but the test can be commented out if needs be.
##
##-------------------------------------------------------------------
##
## Changes
##  Jan 2010
##  Removed some RoM scripts which kept the Abandon City event from happening under BUG 4.2 and BTS 1.19
##
##  April 2009
##	A moders section of this code now allows a single place for the setting of the "parameters"
##	 - produce just workers or settlers and workers
##	 - produce 1 worker for every X popuation in the city
##	 - produce 1 settler fo every X population in the city with 1 worker for every Y in the remainder
##   Sell buildings rather than demolish them.  Thanks Zappara
##   Unhappiness from selling religious buildings +1 unhappy for x turns.  Where x depends on game speed.
##   Can not abandon last city.
##   Can not sell free buildings however they need to appear in the list for this program to work.
##
##   Note. If you only have one city and it has no buildings then Ctrl-A will appear not to work.  This was
##   done to to stop a CDT which could be caused otherwise.  Besides there is nothing to sell and you can't
##   abandon your only city.
##   - I had made a typo in the check for this - it is now fixed - thanks Zappara
##
## Late April 2009
##  Civ specific unique units for workers and settlers are now produced when appropriate. - thanks Zappara
##  Percentage of building production cost is now in the parameter section so modders can change it
##    currently set at the Rise of mankind default of 20%.  Popup header text now reflects this percentage.
##  More of the text supports language even if I have not put the language stuff there yet.
##  Fixed to support modular buildings. - thanks Zappara
##
## September 2009
## 	Minor coding changes to make the code cleaner.
##		Includes removing excess coments, define globals once, and put parameter for obsolete reduction.
##	Stopped putting free buildings in the list.  
##		The way the popup works is it puts the items in the list in the order supplied (text and index).
##		It displays (text) and returns (index) for the selected item.
##
##-------------------------------------------------------------------
##
## Potential changes
## 1. has an .ini file (AbandonCity.INI) to hold parameters
##	 - mod is active/inactive
##     - only abandon city (no selling of buildings)
##
## 2. buildings in albhabetical order in the list.
##	
##
## ------------------------------------------
## Decided not to generate upgraded settler units as these could then be settled and the free buildings sold off.
##	- obsolete decision now that selling free buildings gives no money.
##	- further obsolete since now we do not present free buildings to be sold :)
##
## Decided to have the population parameters in the code for modders rather than letting the player change them ad hoc.
##
## Decided that you can sell obsolete buildings.  Just because they are obsolete does not mean that they are not having an effect.
